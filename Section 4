
Section 4:- Structuring Apps with Class-Based Components (33 Min)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Class-Based Components
	class -> Easier code organization 
		  -> Can use state (React System) -> Easier to handle user input
		  -> Understands lifecycle events -> Easier to do things when the app first starts 
		  
2. Application Overview
		if users is northen hemispher between october and march -. Burys Its chilly
					southern hemisphere and March and October 
		if users is northen hemispher between March and October  -. Lets hit the beach
					southern hemisphere and october and march
	
	App challenges 
		-> Need to get the users physical location
		-> Need to determine the current month
		-> Need to change text and styling based on location + month 

3. Scaffolding the App
	create new react project 
	create 2 files index.js  and SeasonDisplay.js 
	
4. Getting a Users Physical Location
		GeolocationAPI
	developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API
	
	const App = () => {
	window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
	position => console.log(position),
	err => console.log(err)
	);
	return <div>Hi there!</div>
	}
	
	check console tag position latitude and longitude 
	if you get error, go to ... sensors tab, go to geolocation and change location san francisco
	
5. Resetting Geolocation Preferences
	chrome -> developer tools -> Settings-> More tools -> Sensors ->  Geolocation -> change location.
	browser view site information -> location -> Ask Default 
	reload browser and see pop up notify to allow location -> click deny for resetting.
	
6. Handling Async Operations with Functional Components 
	JS file loaded by browser
	App component gets created
	we call geolocation service
	app returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML 
	... We get result of geolocation.
	
7. Refactoring from Functional to Class Components
	Rules of Class Components
		-> Must be a Javascript Class
		-> Must extend (subclass) React.Components
		-> Must define a render method that returns some amount of JSX 
	
	class App extends React.Component{
	render(){
	}
	}
	copy the return statement and paste it to the render method
