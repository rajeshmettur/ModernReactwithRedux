	JS(Babel):-
		function transform(offset) {
	  const cos = Math.cos(offset);
	  const sin = Math.sin(offset);
	 return { transform: `matrix3d(${sin}, ${-cos}, ${sin}, 0, ${-cos}, ${sin}, 0, 0, 0, ${cos}, ${cos}, ${sin}, 0, 0, 0, 1)` };
	}

	class App extends React.Component {
	State = { styleOnes : {}, styleTwos : {} };

	onMouseOver = (event) => {
	  this.setState({
	   styleOnes : transform(-event.clientX /
							 event. clientY),
		styleTwos : transform(event.clientX / event.clientY)
	  });
	}

	render() {
	 return (
	 <div onMouseOver={this.OnMouseOver}">
	  <div className="panel" 
		style={this.state.styleOnes}></div>
	  <div className="panel" 
		style={this.state.styleTwos}></div>
	  </div>
	  )
	}
	}

	ReactDOM.render(
	  <App/>,
	  document.querySelector('#root')
	)
	
	PreProcessor -> React , ReactDOM Libraries. CSS -> Material 

3. Our First App
	Tool -> goo.gl/T6zQ9q 
	Use above code to write and test 

4. Codepen Solution and Blank White Screen Help
	Make sure to type ReactDOM instead of ReactDom and check return keyword used in render() method.

5. Critical Questions!
	What is React and its purpose?
	 React is a Javascript library and its ultimate purpose is to show HTML content to users 
	 and handle user interaction. 
	
	Why didn't we use Redux to make that app?
		React can work by itself. But it can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries. packages, servers, and database.
		
	what was that 'class' thing?
		A Javascript 'class'. React 'components' are made using either Javascript functions or classes.
	what was the html looking stuff?
		Its JSX, it looks like HTML and can be placed in Javascript code. Determines the content of our Reac app just like normal HTML.
	How did the screen change when we moved the mouse?
		An event Handler. Event Handlers are used to detect user interaction and respond to it.
	Why did we add two libraries React and ReactDOM? 
		React is split into two separate libraries. React knows what a component is and how to make components work together. 
		ReactDOM knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.
		
6. Installing Node JS
	https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    node -v 
7. Important Update about React App Generation
	Removed support for generating from a Global Install. 
		npx create-react-app my app
	For uninstall 
		npm uninstall -g create-react-app 
	For Mac/Linux 
		rm -rf /usr/local/bin/create-react-app

8. Generating a React Project
	git-> npm install -g create-react-app
	alternate commnad -> npx create-react-app nameofproject 
	npm version higher 5.0 -> use npx create-react-app nameofproject 
9. Why Create React App?
	react, react-dom , react-scripts 
	Javascript -> ES5, ES2015, ES2016,ES2017,ES2018, ES2019
	ES5 - Supported across all browsers.
	ES2015, ES2016,ES2017,ES2018, ES2019 -> Babel -> ES5 (Support all browser)
	Babel -> converts ES2015 ES2016 Code into ES5 which supported by all browsers.
	Other than that, Webpack, Dev Server and etc..

10. Exploring a Create-React-App Project
	use code editor -> vs code to open react project 
		src -> Folder where we put all the source code we write.
		public -> Folder that stores static files like images
		node_modules -> Folder that contains all our project dependencies
		package.json -> Records our project dependencies and configures of our project
		package-lock.json ->Records the exact version of packages that we install
		ReadMe.md ->Instructions on how to use this project 
		.gitignore -> ignore files write here
	
11. Starting and Stopping a React App
	 cd new-project 
	 npm start 
	 opens react app in browser http://localhost:3000. 
	 stop react app -> Press Control + C
	 start again -> npm start 
	 port in use message -> use another port - Yes -> use 3001
     localhost : 3000 is not work -> use 192.168.0.1 instead of localhost 

12. Javascript Module Systems
	index.js
	//Import the React and ReactDOM Libraries 
		import React from 'react';
		import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
	
	//Create a react component 
		previous ES5 VERSION 
		const React = require('react');
		E2015
		import React from 'react';
		
	//Take the react component and show it on the screen
13. Displaying Content with Functional Components
	A component is a Function or Class that produces HTML to show User (JSX) 
	and handles feedback from User (Using Event Handlers)
	index.js
	//Import the React and ReactDOM Libraries 
		import React from 'react';
		import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
	
	//Create a react component 
		const App = () => {
			return <div>Hi there!</div>;
		}
	
	//Take the react component and show it on the screen
	ReactDOM.render(
	<App/>,
	document.getElementById('#root')
	)

15. Common Questions About My Environment
	 Code editor -> Prettier
	 VS Code theme -> Solarized theme 
	 Terminal -> iterm2
